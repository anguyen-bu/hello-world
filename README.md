# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.

My name is Ann Nguyen. I currently work as a Marketing Data Science Manager at ezCater, where I lead marketing measurement and optimization initiatives. I have several years of experience in marketing analytics and consulting, having worked with companies like Dropbox and Global Poker to build attribution models, experimentation roadmaps, and data-driven growth strategies. Iâ€™m pursuing this program to strengthen my technical foundation in machine learning and statistical modeling, and to expand the ways I can apply data science to solving complex business problems.
